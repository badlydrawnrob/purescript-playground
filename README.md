# Purescript Playground

> It was either Purescript or OCaml!

Taking a spin with "[Functional Programming Made Easier](https://discourse.purescript.org/t/new-purescript-book-functional-programming-made-easier/2390/11)" book, which _says_ it's not too maths heavy, but it's already using flippin' maths notation. I might bail, but giving it a try.

Purescript is NOT popular, but it might be the closest thing to Haskell and Elm Lang, so _I think_ it's worth familiarising myself with, and hope that there's enough transferable knowledge to [Lisp](https://htdp.org/2024-8-20/Book/part_two.html)[^1], [Gleam](https://gleam.run/),

## Tips

1. `npx spago repl` to start
2. [`:paste`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60594693/purescript-how-to-define-function-signature-in-repl) for multiple lines of code
3. Problems with packages? Probably need to [install them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31929406/unknown-module-data-list-in-psci#comment121794172_32004727) (with spago)


## The basic goal

> **To make good art**, maybe a beginners book.

- To understand Elm Lang a little better,
- To build a simple app with simple data,
- To validate simple business models that'll make MONEY,
- "Just Enough" learning to read and write `json`,
- "Just Enough" learning to build small programs,
- "Just Enough" learning to teach to beginners,
- **TO MAKE GOOD ART** ... I shouldn't care about programming!

I'm not interested in:

- ~~Re-learning recursion[^2] ...~~
    - `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc are fine and dandy.

The ultimate goal is to earn enough to pay someone else to worry about this shit. I'm more concerned about high-level thinking, "jobs" theory, sales/marketing, and managing the flow of data between internal and external applications.

Bottom line is, how much customer service management to I want to take on, and what's the swiftest way to start earning?

## ✅ What I'm OK with

> Does your _job to be done_ align with this app's goals?
> No? It's probably not what you're looking for then.
> Be clear about your jobs. Hire and fire your customers.
> If it's working, keep going!

- The Anki flashcards are fairly strong,
- They're simple, maintainable, and people seem to use them ...
- They don't take up much time in terms of "people pleasing",
- They still work if I step away from them for 5 years (mostly),
- The _only_ downside, if there is one, is no interactivity.[^3]

All of these are healthy terms for someone who's had a more project-based career and gets bored easily, or gets curious about other things. I'm not sure I want the pain of dealing with picky customers, or to be clearer, I need to decide on the "job" I'm trying to solve, and those jobs that I'm _not_ solving.


[^1]: Some day I need to whizz through the rest of this book (see GitHub: I think I completed more than what's saved but I'm uncertain). Clojure or other lisp langs may be something to contend with in future (but remember I'm not a proper programmer!)

[^2]: Recursion is pretty handy I'm sure, but doing it _properly_, for instance cycling through a list and sorting them by `abc` or `123` is a skill that takes quite a bit of understanding. I'd rather just use the helper functions in a solid programming language than figure that shit out. `foldl` is straightforward enough, but other functions require some mental gymnastics.

[^3]: Meaning, I don't know how well they're solving people's jobs! Every effort I've made to have interactive issues, polls, helpers, so on, has been met with deafening silence. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing: I have to glean insights from traffic, my own likes and dislikes, and common sense. It may be that they're regularly used by a percentage of downloaders, but they solve their problem well enough that there's no feedback required. Or, people use it once, hate it, and never come back!!
