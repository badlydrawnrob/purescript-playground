# Purescript Playground

> It was either Purescript or OCaml!

Taking a spin with "Functional Programming Made Easier" book, which _says_ it's not too maths heavy, but it's already using flippin' maths notation. I might bail, but giving it a try.

## The basic goal

- I'd like to understand Elm Lang a little better,
- I want to build a simple app with simple data,
- I'm not interested in re-learning recursion ...
- As `map`, `filter`, `reduce` etc are fine enough for me.
- "Just Enough" learning to be able to read/write `json`
- And have a bare bones proof-of-concept app that'll make money.

The ultimate goal is to earn enough to pay someone else to worry about this shit. I'm more concerned about high-level thinking, "jobs" theory, sales/marketing, and managing the flow of data between internal and external applications.

Bottom line is, how much customer service management to I want to take on, and what's the swiftest way to start earning?

## What I'm OK with

> Is this app for you?
> Are you right for this app?
> Hiring and firing customers.
> How am I doing? Is it working?

- The Anki flashcards are fairly strong,
- They're simple, maintainable, and people seem to use them ...
- They don't take up much time in terms of "people pleasing",
- They still work if I step away from them for 5 years (mostly),
- The _only_ downside, if there is one, is no interactivity.[^1]

All of these are healthy terms for someone who's had a more project-based career and gets bored easily, or gets curious about other things. I'm not sure I want the pain of dealing with picky customers, or to be clearer, I need to decide on the "job" I'm trying to solve, and those jobs that I'm _not_ solving.


[^1]: Meaning, I don't know how well they're solving people's jobs! Every effort I've made to have interactive issues, polls, helpers, so on, has been met with deafening silence. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing: I have to glean insights from traffic, my own likes and dislikes, and common sense. It may be that they're regularly used by a percentage of downloaders, but they solve their problem well enough that there's no feedback required. Or, people use it once, hate it, and never come back!!
